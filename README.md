# Filament Profiles for Bambu Lab X1C

These are filament profiles that I have developed for the Bambu Lab X1C 3D-printer.

These profiles will work with both [BambuStudio](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio) and [OrcaSlicer](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer). 

## How to Install Profiles
1. Close your slicer program.
1. Copy the desired filament JSON file to the appropriate filament profile directory for your slicer:
   - Windows
     - BambuStudio: %AppData%\BambuStudio\user\default\filament
     - OrcaSlicer: %AppData%\OrcaSlicer\user\default\filament
1. Re-open your slicer program. The filament profiles will show up "User Presets".

NOTE: If you have installed the Bambu Network plug-in, filament profiles may be stored under a numeric user name instead of "default".
